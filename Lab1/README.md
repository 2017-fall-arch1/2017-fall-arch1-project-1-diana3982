# Employee-System-Lab-1
Lab 1 had us create a binary search tree with strings.
The program needed to add an employee, delete an employee, and display the current tree to show all employees currently in the tree.

This directory contains: 
bst.c, bst.h, runBst.c

To compile:
* $ make
To test:
* $ make demo
To delete binaries:
* $ make clean
